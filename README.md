Making an "etch-a-sketch" javascript/jquery program. Should be fun!

Update:

This one was much less time consuming than the google project, but more fulfilling.

There were a few hiccups in trying to figure out where to start, but once I got going, it became easy.

I may return one day and add a lot more functionality. I'd like to pretty it up (it's ugly), add color options and much more. I'll probably add it to the website I plan on creating after the Odin Project.
